Enabling SSH

Get-VMHost | Foreach {Start-VMHostService -HostService ($_ | Get-VMHostService | Where { $_.Key -eq "TSM-SSH"} )}

Get-VMHost | Foreach {Start-VMHostService -HostService ($_ | Get-VMHostService | Where { $_.Key -eq "TSM-SSH"} )}
If you want to filter which hosts you want to enable SSH on, specify them on the Get-VMHost:

Get-VMHost -Name MyHosts*| Foreach {Start-VMHostService -HostService ($_ | Get-VMHostService | Where { $_.Key -eq "TSM-SSH"} )}
1
Get-VMHost -Name MyHosts*| Foreach {Start-VMHostService -HostService ($_ | Get-VMHostService | Where { $_.Key -eq "TSM-SSH"} )}
Check which hosts still have SSH enabled.

Get-VMHost | Get-VMHostService | Where { $_.Key -eq "TSM-SSH" } |select VMHost, Label, Running
1
Get-VMHost | Get-VMHostService | Where { $_.Key -eq "TSM-SSH" } |select VMHost, Label, Running
By the way, if you were wondering what TSM stands for, it is “Technical Support Mode”.

Disabling SSH
If you want to disable SSH on all hosts still running SSH, you can use the following:

Get-VMHost | Foreach {Stop-VMHostService -HostService ($_ | Get-VMHostService | Where { $_.Key -eq "TSM-SSH"} )}
1
Get-VMHost | Foreach {Stop-VMHostService -HostService ($_ | Get-VMHostService | Where { $_.Key -eq "TSM-SSH"} )}
Shorter/faster
The oneliners I used above are retrieving the objects for hosts with Get-VMHost. After that they get processed by the Get-VMHostservice. The oneliner can be simplified by using the host directly in the Get-VMHostService cmdlet. It seems a little bit faster.

Get-VMHostService -VMHost "esx01.local" | Where-Object {$_.Key -eq "TSM-SSH"}
1
Get-VMHostService -VMHost "esx01.local" | Where-Object {$_.Key -eq "TSM-SSH"}
The reason that I’m still using the first method is that I really don’t know. I want to say that it is more logical than the latter, but it isn’t. “Getting the object for VMHost and then looping through it, feeding it through the Stop-VMHostService with parameters from Get-VMHostService to stop them” isn’t more logical than “Get the services from host esx01.local, select the SSH service and stop it”.

PowerShell
Get-VMHostService -VMHost * | Where-Object {$_.Key -eq "TSM-SSH" } | Stop-VMHostService
1
Get-VMHostService -VMHost * | Where-Object {$_.Key -eq "TSM-SSH" } | Stop-VMHostService
